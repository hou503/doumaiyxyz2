        <p>In a game that ended today, the pelican lost 125-135 to the nets. Ingram has undoubtedly become the most dazzling star in this game. He got 40 points, 5 rebounds and 5 assists in 17-for-24 shooting and Owen is no inferior to Biao. From holding the ball under the basket, to a variety of mid-range hits, Ingram explained his offensive talent to everyone. It’s not just saying that he can be selected as the top one, but he has real talent. In the Lakers, due to Walton’s equalitarianism, Ingram’s data was not available. With Zion injured, Ingram got the boss’s privilege, and he finally fulfilled his talent to complete the explosion in the fourth year.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/24, 17, 40 + 5! Ingram is crazy. Who's the boss of pelican, and the suspense/ad50052096fe4f78b501340f6248e0e1.jpg" alt="24, 17, 40 + 5! Ingram is crazy. Who&#39;s the boss of pelican, and the suspense"><br>Today, both sides are in the process of hanging, but there is no doubt that the strength of the nets is stronger and better configuration, Pelican has been lagging behind. But under Ingram’s leadership, the pelicans continued to attack, but they were unable to support themselves. Pelican and the nets started today’s first quarter, where Allen scored two points under the basket, with prince and Harris scoring three points each. Holliday and Bauer on the pelican’s side also responded. After that Owen and Ingram got into a fight again. The net led 33-27 in the first quarter.<br>The second quarter of the net hit the attack wave, Jordan in the basket can not be stopped. The nets had a leadership advantage of 11 points. But Ingram once again became the God of death, he threw two unreasonable points in a row, and kept making free throws to kill and even the difference.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/24, 17, 40 + 5! Ingram is crazy. Who's the boss of pelican, and the suspense/0c6a40b677114669b04de82a9fc673af.jpg" alt="24, 17, 40 + 5! Ingram is crazy. Who&#39;s the boss of pelican, and the suspense"><br>Owen is not willing to be outdone, in Ingram fire, Owen also hit three-point response. The Nets’ two big players, left and temple, followed Owen closely, using two three points to put out the pelican’s counterattack momentum. And Owen also performed the same distance performance as Ingram at the end of the season, leading the nets to a half-time lead of 17 points.<br>In the second half, Pelican finally woke up, Ingram scored 2 + 1, Bauer also started the attack mode, a breakthrough with the ball scored 2 points, and then raised his hand outside the three-point line. Hart also came out and hit three points with Bauer again, Ingram was not weak, he also hit three points. In the pelican’s three-point rain, the advantage of the nets began to be eroded clean.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/24, 17, 40 + 5! Ingram is crazy. Who's the boss of pelican, and the suspense/937755f94987472fb13785e49a1065c8.jpg" alt="24, 17, 40 + 5! Ingram is crazy. Who&#39;s the boss of pelican, and the suspense"><br>The pelican scored 48 points in the third quarter, tracking the 17 point gap to 6 points, but the net’s substitute blew up in the last quarter. It was Temple who scored three points each with Ding Weidi, and the difference was widened to 11 points. Although Ingram and Redick scored crazily after that, and at one point the difference was close to 2 points, Owen + Harris + left killed the pelican at a crucial moment. In particular, Harris’s last-minute three-point death is really killing.<br>However, Ingram’s performance is amazing. It’s terrible to get 40 points in 17 of 24 shots. Even Durant at the top, right?<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/24, 17, 40 + 5! Ingram is crazy. Who's the boss of pelican, and the suspense/4967fe37051646808c4ee2483049b54f.jpg" alt="24, 17, 40 + 5! Ingram is crazy. Who&#39;s the boss of pelican, and the suspense"><br>In addition, Owen is also excellent. He got 37 points, 9 assists and 3 steals in 13 of 21 games. Unfortunately, Ingram and Owen’s teammates are still quite poor. If Zion is still there, maybe the pelican has another fight. But there is no way that Zion is too fragile. Many people say that Zion is the leader of pelicans, but in the current situation, Ingram is the real emperor of pelicans.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/24, 17, 40 + 5! Ingram is crazy. Who's the boss of pelican, and the suspense/c1ec395dfabd480f840a93b9e677e497.jpg" alt="24, 17, 40 + 5! Ingram is crazy. Who&#39;s the boss of pelican, and the suspense"><br>It’s worth mentioning that when pelicans and Lakers started their negotiations, they didn’t want Ingram but Kuzma. And the Lakers don’t give it, for now. The pelicans are blessed with misfortune. They have a young Durant. Even if Zion comes back, he can only be an assistant. Ingram is 97 years old. He is only 22 years old and younger than some rookies.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/24, 17, 40 + 5! Ingram is crazy.
