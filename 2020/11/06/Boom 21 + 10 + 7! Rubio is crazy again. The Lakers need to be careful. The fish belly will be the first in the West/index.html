        <p>The Suns beat the 76ers 114-109 at home in a match that ended today. In the absence of ebbed, the invincible body of the 76ers was broken by the sun. The current record is 5-1 and the last winning team of the season is over. After the Suns won the game, they have won three in a row. The Suns, 5-2 this season, have finished second in the Western Conference and are now catching up with the No. 1 Los Angeles Lakers. I have to say that the sun is strong enough, especially the arrival of Rubio. He liberated the scoring machine, little kobibuk.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Boom 21 + 10 + 7! Rubio is crazy again. The Lakers need to be careful. The fish belly will be the first in the West/90a49acf803b4b2395d5ee2ccc397275.jpg" alt="Boom 21 + 10 + 7! Rubio is crazy again. The Lakers need to be careful. The fish belly will be the first in the West"><br>Today, the Suns are not only good at the offensive end, but also good at the defensive end. They seem to have changed from a fish belly team to a championship team, all kinds of tactics are orderly. At the beginning of the first quarter, the Suns played against the 76ers, where Simmons slammed the basket and scored, while Harris and hofford scored five points in a row. Suns side basket’s big general Baines also obtains 4 points in a row, afterward he also in three points. After the first battle, the 76ers are only one point ahead.<br>In the second quarter, both sides felt bad, but they showed the intensity of playoff level at the defensive end. Rubio became the sun’s commander, under his command, the sun in the second quarter against the attack of 76 people, excellent defensive performance. The 76ers were only six points ahead at half-time.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Boom 21 + 10 + 7! Rubio is crazy again. The Lakers need to be careful.

The fish belly will be the first in the West"><br>In the second half, the sun launched a fierce attack, Booker opened the mode of big kill. He scored 11 points in a row, and all weapons from breakthrough to three points to middle distance were taken out. The sun was constantly approaching the differential. After the three points hit by ubre, the sun once drew up the differential. But top paid Mr. Harris worked hard. He scored 2 + 1 in one attack, then lay up again. Help the 76ers lead 1 point in the third quarter to the end.<br>In the fourth quarter, the sun erupted in an all-round way. They started 12-5, but they actually exceeded 76 by 7 points. After his last shoot out, kokmazi came out again today in adversity. He hit two threes to help the 76ers draw the difference again. But the sun side Booker and Rubio’s also got 4 points to respond.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Boom 21 + 10 + 7! Rubio is crazy again. The Lakers need to be careful. The fish belly will be the first in the West/07a45ba4d9044021871b358b92bc6c40.jpg" alt="Boom 21 + 10 + 7! Rubio is crazy again. The Lakers need to be careful. The fish belly will be the first in the West"><br>The Suns took the lead by six points in the last minute, although hofford’s three-point shot raised hopes for the 76ers. But Burke and Rubio finished the harvest again. Booker grabbed a valuable rebounding, and two penalties, Rubio in the final second penalty to kill the suspense of the game.<br>In the whole game, there is no sense of Simons on the 76ers’ side. Basically, it’s just Horford + Harris. Today, Horford scored 32 points and Harris scored 24 points. There’s 20 points for kirkmaz. Simmons only got 6 points, 6 assists and 7 steals. Although Simmons is good at the defensive end and organization, his lack of attack power does affect the 76ers.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Boom 21 + 10 + 7! Rubio is crazy again. The Lakers need to be careful. The fish belly will be the first in the West/22fbddeb1c634680a476c68a47e3fb31.jpg" alt="Boom 21 + 10 + 7! Rubio is crazy again. The Lakers need to be careful. The fish belly will be the first in the West"><br>On the contrary, when all four stars of the sun erupted, Booker scored 40 points with the help of Rubio. And Rubio also got the full data of 21 points, 7 boards and 10 AIDS. Baines, 15 points, 7 boards and 6 boards, helped carry the flag of Aton, and ubre also got 14 points, 6 boards. Now the sun is short of Aton. If he can agree to apply for reducing the suspension, then the sun will be terrible after Aton returns 1 Rubio + 2 buck + 3 ubre + 4 shakiri + 5 Aton, with strong competitiveness in the West<br>At present, the Lakers, 76ers and heat are tied for the first place in the league, 5-1. Obviously, it’s amazing that the sun can reach the second place in the West.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Boom 21 + 10 + 7! Rubio is crazy again. The Lakers need to be careful. The fish belly will be the first in the West/fc1cb3c9b7df49778833ee608d2905b1.jpg" alt="Boom 21 + 10 + 7! Rubio is crazy again. The Lakers need to be careful. The fish belly will be the first in the West"><br>In the past few seasons, the sun’s record can only be said to be poor, they rebuild year after year. Even though the Suns had Booker + ubre + Eaton last season, they still couldn’t make it to the playoffs, and their record continued to be at the bottom. And a deal from the Suns this summer has changed them, Rubio. He joined in six games to help the fish belly into the western second, Rubio can be said to let the sun a dead chess alive.</p>
