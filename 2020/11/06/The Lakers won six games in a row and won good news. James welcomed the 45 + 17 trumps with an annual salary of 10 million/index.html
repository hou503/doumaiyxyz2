        <p>In a game that ended today, the Los Angeles Lakers beat the bulls 118-112 in six straight wins. It was a surprise because the Lakers were 17 points behind in the first half. 48-65 behind. In particular, Davies is in a very bad condition today, he only got 4 points, 2 boards and 2 assists in the first half. James scored 16 points, 8 boards and 4 assists in the first half, but the Lakers were suppressed. The bulls were in great shape in the first half today, they hit 54.3%. In the first half, Kobe white scored 16 points against James. Raven and Potter also scored 22 points in the half.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/The Lakers won six games in a row and won good news. James welcomed the 45 + 17 trumps with an annual salary of 10 million/c3fde8f688e043dca6057503509437c3.jpg" alt="The Lakers won six games in a row and won good news. James welcomed the 45 + 17 trumps with an annual salary of 10 million"><br>Just when all the fans thought the Lakers were gone, they finished the Jedi counterattack in the second half. In the third quarter, the Lakers did not finish the big chase, they hit 32-28 attack wave in a single quarter, only reducing the difference of 17 points to 13 points. But the Lakers went crazy in the fourth quarter, especially with Kuzma and Howard and cook, who exploded at the same time in the fourth quarter. In just four minutes, the Lakers started a strong 16-0 game. They were 13 points behind to 96-93.<br>Among them, Kuzma scored 9 points, Howard scored under the basket in a row, and the defense end was aggressive, while cook hit long-range shots in a row. At that time, the Lakers didn’t have James or Davis in the lineup.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/The Lakers won six games in a row and won good news. James welcomed the 45 + 17 trumps with an annual salary of 10 million/edf7076c44534dd8a5159e822394a13d.jpg" alt="The Lakers won six games in a row and won good news. James welcomed the 45 + 17 trumps with an annual salary of 10 million"><br>But it was a group of bench bandits who played a wave of frenzy. In fact, this is not a game, but several games. The Lakers’ bench has become the trump card of James and Davis. After the Lakers made the big reversal, James and Davis both returned to the court and continued to play high. Kuzma made a mid-range shot, balman bacaluso finished the steals at the defensive end and scored 2 + 1 in the fast break. Cook then received a pass from James to hit three points.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/The Lakers won six games in a row and won good news. James welcomed the 45 + 17 trumps with an annual salary of 10 million/a09c2c9862f94d12994e849657f6f824.jpg" alt="The Lakers won six games in a row and won good news. James welcomed the 45 + 17 trumps with an annual salary of 10 million"><br>Howard slammed under the basket again, and James became the commander, delivering ammunition frequently and shooting in the critical moment. Davis also completed an air contact. The Lakers hit 38-19 in the last quarter. 11 points ahead in the last minute and it’s rubbish time.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/The Lakers won six games in a row and won good news. James welcomed the 45 + 17 trumps with an annual salary of 10 million/6f0b201b0401420f9a0625253dd352b0.jpg" alt="The Lakers won six games in a row and won good news. James welcomed the 45 + 17 trumps with an annual salary of 10 million"><br>James got 30 points, 10 rebounds, 11 assists, three pairs of data, McGrady 10 points, 6 rebounds, 2 blocks, Davis 15 points. Reserve ace cook 17 points 4 boards, Kuzma 15 points 4 boards, Howard 6 points 6 boards, bald Mamba 7 points 3 boards. The Lakers’ backup trump four have scored 45 points and 17 boards, which is a great success for the Lakers to win today.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/The Lakers won six games in a row and won good news. James welcomed the 45 + 17 trumps with an annual salary of 10 million/052bda8599234ee585e1a37bbc17318d.jpg" alt="The Lakers won six games in a row and won good news. James welcomed the 45 + 17 trumps with an annual salary of 10 million"><br>It’s good news for LeBron James to have such a bench gangster. Like the clippers, why do they often make a big reversal when the starting performance is not good? It’s because the Clippers are tough substitutes. The combination of Luwei and Harrell can overcome the difficulties. The Lakers now have their own trump team, especially the Howard Lakers. And today, the annual salary of the four Lakers substitutes is only over 10 million yuan. The price is 45 + 17. The Lakers are laughing.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/The Lakers won six games in a row and won good news. James welcomed the 45 + 17 trumps with an annual salary of 10 million/7221c0a8657d405c8cb627275efdb402.jpg" alt="The Lakers won six games in a row and won good news. James welcomed the 45 + 17 trumps with an annual salary of 10 million"><br>Of course, the Lakers have another piece of bad news. In the first part of today’s third quarter, Pope accidentally twisted his foot when he was ready to return to defense after making a three pointer. I don’t know what’s going on. It’s upsetting. Pop played well today. 21 minutes with 8 points, 3 rebounds and 1 assists.</p>
