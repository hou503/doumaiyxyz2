        <p>In a game that ended today, kings won 113-92 away from Phoenix in a row of two. After five consecutive defeats, the king won two in a row. It has to be said that their condition is also starting to pick up. Before that, coach Walton was under a lot of pressure. I can’t keep my job if I lose. But today, the king’s players also gave their strength, especially the three giants Barnes + Hilde + Fawkes did very well. They defended the dignity of the coach. At first, Walton was ready to leave class, but the three of them made Walton hope again. Maybe the king could save even better.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Big three 65 points! Welcome to the second consecutive win, Walton secretly smiled after the game, which made the West more chaotic/c03842dee6aa41edb4c5519a836dfe06.jpg" alt="Big three 65 points! Welcome to the second consecutive win, Walton secretly smiled after the game, which made the West more chaotic"><br>Today, the king showed his desire to attack from the first quarter. After Morris and Randall led the Knicks to a strong start, the king who found his hand began to fight back. Hilde was unstoppable, scoring 10 points in a row from the outside three to the under basket attack. Fox also continued to attack the Knicks with a sudden penalty, berecha and Ariza also hit long-range shots respectively. King has already surpassed Knicks in the first quarter and gained an 11 point lead.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Big three 65 points!

Welcome to the second consecutive win, Walton secretly smiled after the game, which made the West more chaotic"><br>In the second quarter, the king tried again. They didn’t give Nix any possibility of chasing points. Under the leadership of Holmes and Barnes, the King opened the second quarter with 11-0 difference to more than 20 points. Although the Knicks kept chasing points in the half, the king always responded, so the king still led by 20 points, 61-41.<br>In the third quarter, the king played three crazy, fox + Hilde + Barnes three giants at the same time, one three-point goal in one. The king started a three-point rain, and directly opened the difference to 32 points. After Barnes hit the scoring again and again, fox hit frequently. Don’t fight at the end. Nix disarms and surrenders.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Big three 65 points! Welcome to the second consecutive win, Walton secretly smiled after the game, which made the West more chaotic/facde76bd5b341f3b78e12747753329d.jpg" alt="Big three 65 points! Welcome to the second consecutive win, Walton secretly smiled after the game, which made the West more chaotic"><br>The king’s three giants: Hilde scored 22 points, fox 24 points and 6 assists, Barnes 19 points, and the three combined to score 65 points. In addition, forward Holmes scored 14 points and 10 boards, and center Boris berecha also got 10 points, 8 boards and 6 assists. Nick’s long Barrett scored 22 points and couldn’t get back to the sky.<br>At the end of today’s game, when the king’s first break came into the garbage time, the camera swept to the king’s bench. At that time, Walton was smiling, and he really felt relieved.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Big three 65 points!

Welcome to the second consecutive win, Walton secretly smiled after the game, which made the West more chaotic"><br>As some netizens have said: Walton has packed his bags, Fox and Hilde have brought them back alive, Barnes has closed the door, holding his legs.<br>It can be said that it was the king’s big three that saved Walton today. They let the young manager stay. It’s just that for the west, the rise of the king has made it even more chaotic. In the last game, the king beat the strong jazz, which killed the Knicks. It’s a good omen. After all, last season, King almost made it to the playoffs, but in the end, he was a little bit worse, but he can also make it to the playoffs in the East.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Big three 65 points!

Welcome to the second consecutive win, Walton secretly smiled after the game, which made the West more chaotic"><br>In addition, according to Jason Jones, the athletic reporter, although the kings had a bad start to the season, the team did not lose confidence in Walton, especially Fox and Hilde still trust each other. Fox also befriended Walton before today’s game: “we will support him. He has been doing well since he came here. We trust him and he trusts us</p>
