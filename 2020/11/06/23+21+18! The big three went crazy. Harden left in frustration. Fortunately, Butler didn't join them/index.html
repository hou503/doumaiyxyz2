        <p>In a game that ended today, the heat won 129-100 at home. The heat played comfortably in this game. They basically spent the game in a single quarter. Let the game become the human purgatory of the opponent, from the beginning of the first quarter, the heat showed the horrible scoring ability. Adebayor’s dunk was good, and Butler’s lift on the outside line was a three-point hit. The heat have a 5-0 lead. After that, the heat did not give up, they again played a 21-2 offensive frenzy. Especially this year’s No. 13 rookie Hiro keeps scoring.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/23+21+18! The big three went crazy. Harden left in frustration. Fortunately, Butler didn't join them/0b7a9889f3b9498288268d158879f4d5.jpg" alt="23+21+18! The big three went crazy. Harden left in frustration. Fortunately, Butler didn&#39;t join them"><br>The heat pulled the difference straight to 24, just when all the fans thought the heat’s offensive was slowing down. They had another 10-0 run at the end of the quarter, when the difference had been extended to 32. The heat basically beat the game in a single quarter. But the heat don’t seem to be satisfied. They still want to abuse food and hate their opponents. So at the start of the second quarter, the heat had another 8-0 difference to 41.<br>Only after that did the opponents wake up like a dream. They started to fight back quickly and constantly approached the difference. But the heat can always respond, especially Leonard + Hiro + Robinson, who became the unstoppable General of the heat today. Butler also became the team leader at both ends of attack and defense. The heat were still 25 points ahead at half-time, 71-46.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/23+21+18! The big three went crazy. Harden left in frustration. Fortunately, Butler didn't join them/cfa9700b880a499c9df7650e69403cde.jpg" alt="23+21+18! The big three went crazy. Harden left in frustration. Fortunately, Butler didn&#39;t join them"><br>The heat scored 71 points in the first half, shooting 57.8%. It can be said that the heat’s attack is not too strong, but the opponent’s defense is too poor. In the second half, there was nothing to look forward to. The heat still played brilliantly and didn’t give the opponents any chance. Adebayor was down in the basket. Robinson hit three unreasonable points in a row, and the heat were still 28 points ahead at the end of the three quarters.<br>At the end of the season, the heat no longer gave the chance to let the substitute eat dumplings. The heat are again a wave of 14-0 to fight the opponent to the sky. Directly extend the difference to 40 points. In the end, the heat replaced the main force and let the substitute play at will. Butler couldn’t keep his mouth shut. James Harden and Westbrook left in dismay after the game.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/23+21+18! The big three went crazy. Harden left in frustration. Fortunately, Butler didn't join them/1c11bf71f9864fccbb9a617e204d9095.jpg" alt="23+21+18! The big three went crazy. Harden left in frustration. Fortunately, Butler didn&#39;t join them"><br>In the whole match, the three giants of the heat all contributed. Butler scored 18 points, 7 boards and 9 assists, Robinson 23 points and Leonard 21 points. The three of them are the great heroes of today’s team’s massacre of opponents. It has to be said that when Butler left the 76ers to enter the free market this summer, he did not choose to join the opposition but chose to join the heat, which is the right decision. Even with foresight, because from today’s game you can see that the heat is more tactical and more reasonable than a team.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/23+21+18! The big three went crazy. Harden left in frustration. Fortunately, Butler didn't join them/b00ae001bc9f45f880e5027a47de452b.jpg" alt="23+21+18! The big three went crazy. Harden left in frustration. Fortunately, Butler didn&#39;t join them"><br>If Butler joins a team, can he play comfortably? The whole game depends on one person holding the ball? What’s the point of being a star who doesn’t defend, and the tactic is to shoot three points dead? The defense is still poor, the team is not high enough, infatuated with the small man, if Butler really joined, it is really to mend the sky. Sometimes it’s hard to understand why Wes has to join such a team.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/23+21+18! The big three went crazy. Harden left in frustration. Fortunately, Butler didn't join them/e4ae58562ec746838b80801df6b4f315.jpg" alt="23+21+18! The big three went crazy. Harden left in frustration. Fortunately, Butler didn&#39;t join them"><br>If Wei doesn’t insist on going to the heat this summer, he will be more comfortable. After all, the heat’s tactics and configuration are more reasonable. Butler is also an excellent leader. He has both attack and defense. Especially in the defensive end are conscientious, and the key moment does not drop the chain. Last season when Butler was in the 76ers, but took the team and the Raptors to fight seven times, can only say that it’s a pity that weishao.</p>
