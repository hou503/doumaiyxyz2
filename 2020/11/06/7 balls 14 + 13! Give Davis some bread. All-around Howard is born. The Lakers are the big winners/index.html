        <p>In a game that ended today, the Lakers beat the Spurs 103-96 away for five straight wins. After losing to Clippers at the beginning of the game, the Lakers didn’t lose a single game. It has to be said that they are too dominant. In particular, James and Davis after running in, now with great, and tacit understanding. In addition, the rise of Howard also brought about the transformation of the Lakers. In order to reduce McGrady’s time to reuse Warcraft, we can really see how terrible the best defender in the League used to be. Howard’s frame is too strong. If his bounce can improve with the depth of the season, then the Lakers will be even stronger.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/7 balls 14 + 13! Give Davis some bread. All-around Howard is born. The Lakers are the big winners/b5b42f2e317c45bf9aa6c5bd1729a560.jpg" alt="7 balls 14 + 13! Give Davis some bread. All-around Howard is born. The Lakers are the big winners"><br>Today’s game is also the process of the Lakers play freely, especially the ability to play hard. The Lakers are stronger than the Spurs, and the Spurs show the toughness of the old team. The Lakers pulled back several times, but the Spurs always responded. It’s like today’s first quarter. The Lakers are playing like a tiger. After the Spurs started 5-0, the Lakers kept fighting back. Green’s three-point hit, Bradley and James’ duet combined to score points in a row.<br>The Lakers directly overtook the Spurs, and James started a personal attack mode, scoring a tough 2 + 1. The rivalry between Davis and Aldridge was also a full-scale grind. Davis slammed from dunk, three points to center. The Lakers gradually spread the gap.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/7 balls 14 + 13! Give Davis some bread. All-around Howard is born. The Lakers are the big winners/b24e21bb21ce4f2cbf019308c5efb63d.jpg" alt="7 balls 14 + 13! Give Davis some bread. All-around Howard is born. The Lakers are the big winners"><br>Unfortunately, the Spurs are tough enough. Every time the Lakers pull the difference to 7, they always respond. In the first quarter, the Lakers were only 1 point ahead, and in the second quarter, the Spurs showed the spirit of immortal Xiaoqiang again. The combination of Murray and guy started with a 5-0 direct victory over the Lakers. But the Superman combination of James and Howard also began to work. James continued to score, and Howard also scored under the basket. The Lakers are 9-1.<br>It’s worth mentioning that Howard also showed his versatility in the game. He held the ball at a high position, saw Davis slip to the basket, and fed directly to Davis to complete the free catch. James is also happy not close mouth, Howard this pass has his style. In Howard’s performance at both ends of the attack and defense, the Lakers are braver and braver. James then had a backcourt pass to Bradley to score 2 + 1. Kuzma hit the outpost three points.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/7 balls 14 + 13! Give Davis some bread. All-around Howard is born. The Lakers are the big winners/0f7001d5cd3648aeaef4b2aede0e43f0.jpg" alt="7 balls 14 + 13! Give Davis some bread. All-around Howard is born. The Lakers are the big winners"><br>The Lakers led by 13 points 56-43 in the first half, and Davis became the main point of attack in the first half of the second half. He even got 4 points to extend the difference to 19 points. But the Spurs are the Spurs. Under such adversity, they still show what is team spirit. The combination of drozan and guy stands out and keeps chasing points. In particular, Gai Yong can not be when, at the end of the third quarter, the Spurs have the difference to 5 points.<br>At the end of the season, Murray, the first bootlicker in the Spurs, broke out. He scored 14 points in a row, helping the Spurs catch up to 90 in the last 4 minutes and 10 seconds! But the combination of James and Howard began to work again, James two assists pop scored five points in a row. Howard also put on a strong touch in an offensive round.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/7 balls 14 + 13! Give Davis some bread. All-around Howard is born. The Lakers are the big winners/b4b82a51779c40758d116738dbae5a8e.jpg" alt="7 balls 14 + 13! Give Davis some bread. All-around Howard is born. The Lakers are the big winners"><br>The Lakers regained their advantage 7-0, and both Davis and Howard were the Lakers’ mainstays at the end of the day. Davis hit drozan in singles, Howard blocked Murray again, and the Spurs couldn’t come back. James is still all-around in the game. He has 21 points, 11 boards, 13 assists and 2 breaks. Davis Cut 25 points, 11 boards, 4 hats and 6 hats.<br>Howard is a real eye opener. He got 14 points, 13 boards and 2 caps in 7 out of 20 minutes. It’s worth mentioning that today, McGrady only played 11 minutes, which seems to be a fake starter. Vogel should not want to let Howard play first, want to let him in the reserve as a strange soldier, just like the Clippers use Harrell.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/7 balls 14 + 13! Give Davis some bread. All-around Howard is born. The Lakers are the big winners/5487edb71d14405bbd98c1b4bce7c031.jpg" alt="7 balls 14 + 13! Give Davis some bread. All-around Howard is born. The Lakers are the big winners"><br>Use Howard to stimulate the second team’s vitality, so Howard’s time is basically the same as the first round, Vogel decided to be wise, now Howard is great, Lakers blood earned.</p>
