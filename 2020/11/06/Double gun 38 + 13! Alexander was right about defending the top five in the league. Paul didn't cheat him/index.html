        <p>In the game that ended today, thunder beat Pelican 115-104 and got another victory. Today’s thunder really showed everyone their strength, even though Ingram was injured in the second quarter and left, Pelican strength fell. But thunder also made a pleasant attack. Especially Chris Paul, who scored 15 points, 9 assists and 3 steals, did a good job in the series. Paul’s presence made Alexander comfortable. He was in charge of attacking and scoring. Alexander had the highest firing power in the team.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Double gun 38 + 13! Alexander was right about defending the top five in the league. Paul didn't cheat him/04e0fd1bd36f465290e729abff35e305.jpg" alt="Double gun 38 + 13! Alexander was right about defending the top five in the league. Paul didn&#39;t cheat him"><br>Today’s game is also downwind and downwater, in the first quarter Alexander showed a good outside touch, he and Gallinari hit three points respectively. Thunder started 10-2. After that, thunder’s second lineup betzley and Diallo also played brilliantly, and thunder had a 7-point lead in the first quarter.<br>In the second section, the thunder fight became braver and braver. Under the leadership of Paul and Pelican, they were hanged. Okafu and Redick scored five points on this side and Alexander scored six in response. Redick made another long-range shot, okafu scored under the basket, Paul started the day mode, hit three difficult points, let thunder lead five points in half-time.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Double gun 38 + 13! Alexander was right about defending the top five in the league. Paul didn't cheat him/6eb1254844774e6e8b96991af92dd90c.jpg" alt="Double gun 38 + 13! Alexander was right about defending the top five in the league. Paul didn&#39;t cheat him"><br>In the second half, Paul was in perfect form. At the beginning of the three quarters, he helped Gary to dunk and score. Then Paul scored three more points. The thunder hit a wave of climax, and betsley added fuel to the fire. One person takes 7 points in a row bravely not to be taken, thunder pulls the difference to 8 points in the third quarter. At the end of the day, under the leadership of Schroeder and betzley, thunder took a 10 point lead, basically killing suspense. Although Pelican responded to a wave of 7-0, Gallinari hit three points at the critical moment. Schroeder also picked up the offensive flag at the last moment. He shot 6 points inside out to completely cover the coffin.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Double gun 38 + 13! Alexander was right about defending the top five in the league. Paul didn't cheat him/cc169faa35374070b3df935d4f78d49d.jpg" alt="Double gun 38 + 13! Alexander was right about defending the top five in the league. Paul didn&#39;t cheat him"><br>In the whole game, the thunderbolt double shot showed great strength. Paul scored 15 points, 9 assists, 3 steals, Alexander scored 23 points, 8 boards and 4 assists. The two men together scored 38 + 13 divine courage data. In addition, the space giant garrinari also got 16 points, the basket’s overlord Noel scored 8 points and sent out 6 blocks.<br>Three substitute muskets, betzley 17, Schroeder 17 9, Diallo 12 5. Thunder today played a real team basketball, in both ends of the attack and defense showed their own state. It’s worth mentioning that thunder’s defense in the new season is still the top one. They rank the fifth in the league with 101.8 points per game, while weishao’s new host defense is the bottom of the whole league.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Double gun 38 + 13! Alexander was right about defending the top five in the league. Paul didn't cheat him/47a25916b1ae4a6799bc82eab7c57196.jpg" alt="Double gun 38 + 13! Alexander was right about defending the top five in the league. Paul didn&#39;t cheat him"><br>Paul really didn’t cheat Alexander. He was a mentor and did his best to help Alexander grow. It’s not about grabbing the ball to help young people grow as much as possible. Alexander also admitted a fact after today’s game. Paul is like a big brother, giving him a very comfortable feeling.<br>Alexandria said: “Paul told me that there was a reason for him to pass the ball to me. He wanted me to keep shooting. This sentence has been lingering in my mind. He and his teammates trust me very much, he makes me more comfortable and confident on the court. Paul is Paul. He’s our backbone now. Let’s stick to our game plan. So thanks for his presence in the team, he made us progress!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Double gun 38 + 13! Alexander was right about defending the top five in the league. Paul didn't cheat him/042b608e86544331adb73db568ce43d2.jpg" alt="Double gun 38 + 13! Alexander was right about defending the top five in the league. Paul didn&#39;t cheat him"><br>It’s worth mentioning that Donovan also showed his cards after the game. He thinks thunder has the ability to reach the playoffs in the West. Especially now their condition is constantly improving. When Robertson returns, thunder will be ready to set sail.</p>
