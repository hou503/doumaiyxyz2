        <p>The Los Angeles Lakers are in good shape in the new season. After losing to the Clippers in the first game, it seems that they have got through the two pulse of the governor. They won a wave of five and five in a row. LeBron James has a feeling of returning to the top. It’s frustrating that the Lakers didn’t make it to the playoffs last season. Not only are Lakers fans ridiculed, but James is also questioned and ridiculed, especially for his groin injury and his comeback failed to lead the team to win.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Five wins in a row! James finally let it out and made a promise to Davis/69aed9e6ee034c3fae6d8985a19fb820.jpg" alt="Five wins in a row! James finally let it out and made a promise to Davis"><br>At that time, the US media thought that James had lost his dominance and failed to play Clippers at the beginning of the new season. The US media even said that James had retired from the throne. But James returned with action. In addition, after the Lakers won five consecutive games, James couldn’t help but vent. In the interview, he was even a little angry, especially the external evaluation of his groin injury, James could not bear it any more.<br>James finally explained why he was not in good shape and could not lead the team to the playoffs after returning last season. James thought that his groin was still in tears at that time, but he forced to come back, but did not get the understanding of the outside world.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Five wins in a row! James finally let it out and made a promise to Davis/f777b6b532f44120b526535cf30547f1.jpg" alt="Five wins in a row! James finally let it out and made a promise to Davis"><br>James said that last season after he came back, his condition greatly decreased, especially his movement speed and explosive power. Some of the movements before the injury could not be performed, and the injury destroyed everything. The groin injury even affected James’ defense, after holding it for seven months. Obviously James had a showdown, and he made a big commitment. In the new season, if he is injured, he will not be forced to return as last season, which is not good for the team and himself.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Five wins in a row! James finally let it out and made a promise to Davis/a5f0d65d82b34ca482ac57f9b951bce7.jpg" alt="Five wins in a row! James finally let it out and made a promise to Davis"><br>Davis also announced James’ decision in an interview today, and he has already told bushbrow what he thinks.<br>Davis said: “people always misunderstand LeBron, especially last season. They question his defense, but I think in the new season LeBron just wants to be himself. He used to be a great defender. Especially in the past few games, we have done our best in defense. As he told me, he didn’t want to get hurt any more, so he got his speed back, he got his body back to the point where he could play defense again. In addition, we will also support him (we got his back) at the defensive end   “<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Five wins in a row! James finally let it out and made a promise to Davis/f71565ab8758405a9872f2f7d4a0c519.jpg" alt="Five wins in a row! James finally let it out and made a promise to Davis"><br>It has to be said that Davis understands James. Today, Davis joked. James calls Jamie’s combination “peanut butter banana sandwich”. James hopes that in the future, their combination can be turned into “peanut butter jam sandwich”. Because peanut butter jam sandwich is a combination of James and Wade, their cooperation has been practiced.<br>So becoming a peanut butter jam sandwich is the next step for James and Davis. In addition, Howard today also ushered in a big positive, he used performance to defeat the biggest black man in his career. He’s Lakers star Shaq. We all know O’Neill is a Howard black powder. He always goes to black Howard with all his heart. It’s not pleasant to see Warcraft.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Five wins in a row! James finally let it out and made a promise to Davis/8d3179895706464e88659df27e63b5ef.jpg" alt="Five wins in a row! James finally let it out and made a promise to Davis"><br>But today O’Neill finally recognized Howard and began to appreciate his professional attitude. O’Neill published an interview video of Howard on the INS on social media. In the interview, Howard said that in his mind, the best team in the history of the Lakers is: James + magician + Kobe + O’Neill + Jabbar, and the sixth is Howard himself.<br>O’Neill was very satisfied with this, he praised Howard: “thank you, Superman Howard, you played well, keep it up, be proud of you!  </p>
