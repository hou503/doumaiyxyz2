        <p>In a game that ended today, the pelican lost 125-135 to the nets. Ingram became the protagonist of the game, he played 37 minutes, 24-for-17, got 40 points, 5 rebounds, 5 assists, 2 steals. Although he couldn’t lead the pelican to victory, Ingram did his best. He worked hard to drive his teammates and compete with Owen. If it weren’t for Ingram to hold on to the pelicans today, they would have collapsed. And Ingram was not afraid of Owen, he did not lose.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Roar 40 + 5 + 5! But the pelican made Ingram cold, and only Zion was in his heart/98d40d1631664e8284acdee9e87f8ad0.jpg" alt="Roar 40 + 5 + 5! But the pelican made Ingram cold, and only Zion was in his heart"><br>It is worth mentioning that Ingram’s performance has also become the first person in the history of pelicans. He scored 181 points in the first seven games, exceeding demarchus cousins’ 155 points, ranking first in history. In this season, Ingram can get the data of 26 + 7 + 3 in 32 games per game, with a hit rate of 55.2%, a three-point hit rate of 48.6%, and an average of 2.4 three-points per game.<br>There is no doubt that the Los Angeles Lakers gave the pelican not a low-end Durant, but a young Durant. Durant, a 22-year-old who is younger than some rookies, is already in his fourth season.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Roar 40 + 5 + 5! But the pelican made Ingram cold, and only Zion was in his heart/278a7b48f74444018e1d93279c0286b5.jpg" alt="Roar 40 + 5 + 5! But the pelican made Ingram cold, and only Zion was in his heart"><br>Durant also hugged and talked with Ingram after today’s game. It’s worth mentioning that Ingram’s height is no different from Durant’s. In the previous official height of pelicans, Ingram’s barefoot is only 2.01 meters, while Durant’s barefoot is 2.08 meters. How do pelicans measure their height? The difficulty is to measure Ingram’s hunchback? Ingram’s official height was 2.06 meters when he was in the Lakers. Today, his height is almost 2.06 meters compared with Durant’s, slightly shorter than Durant’s.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Roar 40 + 5 + 5! But the pelican made Ingram cold, and only Zion was in his heart/7581bb37a0ab413ba21afc2a8eb4bd50.jpg" alt="Roar 40 + 5 + 5! But the pelican made Ingram cold, and only Zion was in his heart"><br>But just when everyone thought Ingram would become the pelican’s new boss, manager Jim Terry’s comments on Ingram after the game were chilling. He thinks Ingram can’t be the pelican’s boss even if he plays like this.<br>“From a player’s point of view, Ingram is a person who will try his best to help the team win the game,” he said. But from the perspective of leadership, I don’t think Ingram can be a leader yet. We’re still looking for someone who can stand up. Of course, hollerdy is an excellent leader, but we still want to find a more suitable leader, a player who can really lead the team   “<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Roar 40 + 5 + 5! But the pelican made Ingram cold, and only Zion was in his heart/0877e11a23b240fdb67cb68293be395b.jpg" alt="Roar 40 + 5 + 5! But the pelican made Ingram cold, and only Zion was in his heart"><br>Kim Terry’s meaning is self-evident. It’s still Zion Williams. Who else can he say? Ingram has no problem with his skills, but not with his leadership. And hollerdy has leadership, but not enough skills. So the pelican’s choice is Zion. Of course, if we give the pelican a dongqiqi, we don’t need to say anything.<br>But it’s definitely not good news for Ingram, who played so hard but still couldn’t get the pelican’s heart.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Roar 40 + 5 + 5! But the pelican made Ingram cold, and only Zion was in his heart/f2b4f5da0b3c4099acb63b8cffbcc5b2.jpg" alt="Roar 40 + 5 + 5! But the pelican made Ingram cold, and only Zion was in his heart"><br>Is Zion great? He is less than 2 meters tall and weighs 127 kg, which his knee can’t bear at all. After losing weight, Zion is not like a player. Is Zion really more suitable to be the team leader than Ingram?</p>
