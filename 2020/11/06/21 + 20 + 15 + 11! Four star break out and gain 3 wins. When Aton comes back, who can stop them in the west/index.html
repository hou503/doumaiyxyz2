        <p>In a game that ended today, the Suns beat the Grizzlies 114-105 away. It has to be said that the Suns have become the big black horses in the new season. When they started last season, they were very poor. But the Suns are really a strange team because they have an attribute. It’s just that playing the bucks is very tough. The sun played the Bucks last season and couldn’t take care of themselves. And this season the Suns will continue to play the Bucks, they start very strong. After today’s win, the Suns are 3-2. They won 3 games, which was unbelievable in the past.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/21 + 20 + 15 + 11! Four star break out and gain 3 wins.

When Aton comes back, who can stop them in the west"><br>Today’s match reflects the spirit of suns. They are totally different. Especially, the joining of Rubio this summer has liberated the pressure of Booker’s organization. He doesn’t need to be as dual-purpose as he used to be. He just needs to do a good job of breaking points. Booker is scoring at other times.<br>At the beginning of today’s first quarter, the sun showed its excellent firepower. Booker broke through, Rubio went through the needle, Baines could eat bread under the basket and protect the frame. Saric opened the space to cast three points, and ubre swam away. Johnson and Kaminsky’s reserve combination, is a contribution on the court. The Suns lead 7 points 31-24 in the first quarter.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/21 + 20 + 15 + 11! Four star break out and gain 3 wins. When Aton comes back, who can stop them in the west/24764aefc5e740ffbc10ec58b542cd1c.jpg" alt="21 + 20 + 15 + 11! Four star break out and gain 3 wins. When Aton comes back, who can stop them in the west"><br>In the second quarter, the sun once led by 12 points, but the Grizzlies began to strangle the sun’s outside line, so they didn’t let it go easily. With the touch of the sun, the Grizzlies start to fight back. Under the leadership of top scorer Morant, they hit a 16-2 attack wave to surpass 2 points. When the Suns were on the brink of extinction, the bench played again. Kaminsky made free throws in a row, the Suns were 2 points behind in half-time<br>After adjustment, the Suns finally found the hand in the second half. Baines hit two three points in a row, and ubre hit the basket to score two points and then made up the basket. Booker also shot in and out to score 5 points, and the sun was 5 points higher than the Grizzlies. But Booker continued to attack the Grizzlies, and the sun made another 16-2 attack, leading by 13 points at the end of the third quarter.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/21 + 20 + 15 + 11! Four star break out and gain 3 wins. When Aton comes back, who can stop them in the west/499d225ed0d64fd0ae6b3cc6a5bbf681.jpg" alt="21 + 20 + 15 + 11! Four star break out and gain 3 wins. When Aton comes back, who can stop them in the west"><br>At the end of the game, the two sides fell into a deadlock. Anderson of Grizzlies hit three points, Brooks hit the basket and even got four points, Johnson also hit three points to respond, and Baines even got five points. The difference has been around 10 points, and finally shalich killed the game. At the last moment, he hit three points on the outside, and the Grizzlies could only surrender.<br>In the whole game, all four stars of the sun have delivered goods. Kobe Bryant scored 21 points and shot 8 out of 13, and shot 3 out of 3. It’s very reasonable and not indiscriminate. Baines scored 20 points and scored four-and-a-third, picking up the inside flag in the absence of Eaton. The flank’s ubre got 15 points, Rubio today feel bad 12 4, but also got 11 points 5 rebounds 6 assists data.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/21 + 20 + 15 + 11! Four star break out and gain 3 wins. When Aton comes back, who can stop them in the west/7de79d5de38f4ccc910838c1d2746fe6.jpg" alt="21 + 20 + 15 + 11! Four star break out and gain 3 wins. When Aton comes back, who can stop them in the west"><br>Earlier, according to NBA reporter Sean deveney, Aton faced a 25 game ban for violating the NBA drug ban. But recently, Aton plans to apply to the League to reduce the number of banned matches. In addition, Aton will meet with the players’ Union and the NBA, hoping to reduce the ban.<br>If Aton can return ahead of time, then the sun can put on a terrifying starting five tigers: 1 Rubio + 2 buck + 3 ubre + 4 sharic + 5 Aton.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/21 + 20 + 15 + 11! Four star break out and gain 3 wins. When Aton comes back, who can stop them in the west/3b0c21ad31764fa6a96b05f42e9ed086.jpg" alt="21 + 20 + 15 + 11! Four star break out and gain 3 wins. When Aton comes back, who can stop them in the west"><br>Such a starting five tigers, the whole west have to tremble, after all, before the sun beat the Clippers. If the sun is in order, who can stop them in the west? In the past, the sun didn’t want a showdown. Now they have a card.</p>
