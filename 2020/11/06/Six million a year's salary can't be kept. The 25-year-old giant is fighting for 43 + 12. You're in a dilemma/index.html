        <p>Los Angeles Clippers avenged jazz 105-94 at home today. The main character of today’s game is undoubtedly Leonard. Today, Xiao Ka is wandering between hell and heaven. Leonard became a blacksmith in the first half. But he broke out in the second half, especially in the last quarter when he scored 18 points to break the jazz. Leonard has become the king of the last quarter of the season, averaging 12.6 points in the last quarter, temporarily ranking first in the league.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Six million a year's salary can't be kept. The 25-year-old giant is fighting for 43 + 12. You're in a dilemma/f1bea7a1b3ca4cc18d3389c95be4f10b.jpg" alt="Six million a year&#39;s salary can&#39;t be kept. The 25-year-old giant is fighting for 43 + 12. You&#39;re in a dilemma"><br>The Clippers are currently third in the West with a 5-2 record, with Leonard playing six games. It has to be said that Leonard joined the Clippers seamlessly. He is not the same as some superstars who hold the ball wildly and play by themselves, because Leonard does not need a lot of players to hold the ball, so the players of the clippers have the right to control the ball, which increases their enthusiasm invisibly.<br>After all, what’s the point of watching four people play by themselves, playing outside and shooting? At the end of the day, basketball is still a five person sport, and Leonard explains it perfectly. And it’s very tough, and it’s always on the line<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Six million a year's salary can't be kept. The 25-year-old giant is fighting for 43 + 12. You're in a dilemma/f61d8740f4084d789b0c737d950a7492.jpg" alt="Six million a year&#39;s salary can&#39;t be kept. The 25-year-old giant is fighting for 43 + 12. You&#39;re in a dilemma"><br>The most important thing is that Leonard has invested a lot of energy in the defensive side, and he never throws too much when his hand is not good. After today’s game, Leonard talked about the team’s winning when he said that he felt bad in the first half, but he tried to give everything on the defensive side. Leonard also praised the defense of his teammates, which can limit a team’s score to less than 100 points, which shows the face of the team itself.<br>In addition to Leonard, today the Clippers also grabbed 16 offensive rebounds, their total rebounds compared to the Jazz: 54-37, won 14. Of the eight rebounds that Harrell grabbed, six were offensive rebounds, and old rivers was named for praise.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Six million a year's salary can't be kept. The 25-year-old giant is fighting for 43 + 12. You're in a dilemma/7a3442ea85ba4813a709f540b43054fd.jpg" alt="Six million a year&#39;s salary can&#39;t be kept. The 25-year-old giant is fighting for 43 + 12. You&#39;re in a dilemma"><br>Today, Harrell played 30 minutes and got 19 points, 8 rebounds and 2 assists. It is worth mentioning that in the last game, Harrell also scored 24 + 4. Harrell scored 43 + 12 in two games, with 16 out of 21 shooting.<br>In the seven games this season, Harrell can get 19.3 points, 6.9 rebounds and 2 assists in an average of 28 minutes, with a hit rate of 73.6%. He has not made three points. Harrell, who earned $6 million this season, signed a $12 million two-year contract with the Clippers in the summer of 18, which expires in the summer of 20.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Six million a year's salary can't be kept. The 25-year-old giant is fighting for 43 + 12. You're in a dilemma/3215ec6a67d14b3ea700f35171651f4f.jpg" alt="Six million a year&#39;s salary can&#39;t be kept. The 25-year-old giant is fighting for 43 + 12. You&#39;re in a dilemma"><br>Harrell, 25, was born in 1994. There is no doubt that the contract year of Harrell has ushered in the outbreak. For clippers, 6 million a year’s salary may not be retained, at least 10 million a year’s salary is needed. Harrell’s annual salary of 20 million is certainly unrealistic. After all, he is too short and has no long-range shooting ability. The defensive end can’t be used as the big gate of the team and the small guard of the outside line. In terms of positioning, Harrell is a dream green who ends up in the basket without passing the ball.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Six million a year's salary can't be kept. The 25-year-old giant is fighting for 43 + 12. You're in a dilemma/4daded5896194bb288c2263fd55da025.jpg" alt="Six million a year&#39;s salary can&#39;t be kept. The 25-year-old giant is fighting for 43 + 12. You&#39;re in a dilemma"><br>If Harrell is 2.08 meters tall, he is certainly worth 20 million annual salary, or even 30 million. For the time being, the Clippers are in trouble. It depends on how much Harrell will charge next summer, because Beverly has won a three-year 40 million contract this summer. Harrell is certainly not content with a six million year salary.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Six million a year's salary can't be kept. The 25-year-old giant is fighting for 43 + 12. You're in a dilemma/05b91e88b303443b986dbed153ba3ef1.jpg" alt="Six million a year&#39;s salary can&#39;t be kept. The 25-year-old giant is fighting for 43 + 12. You&#39;re in a dilemma"><br>In terms of the team’s position, the clippers can’t be short of Harrell. He is an important member on the bench. He can play 1 + 1 and surpass 2 with Ludwig. If Harrell can’t stay, the threat of Ludwig will be reduced a lot, and the two are complementary.</p>
