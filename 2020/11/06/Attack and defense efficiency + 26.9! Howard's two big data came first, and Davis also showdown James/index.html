        <p>In a game yesterday, the Lakers beat the Spurs for five straight wins. In that game, Lakers substitute Howard played a hot performance again, he got 14 points, 13 rebounds, 2 assists and 2 blocks in 7-for-7 of the game. Howard dominates the court at both ends of attack and defense. It can be said that Howard’s rise is the key to the Lakers’ five consecutive wins.<br>How many times when the Lakers are on the brink of extinction, Howard has become a wonder soldier. Without Howard but relying on McGrady, the Lakers can’t win five consecutive games. This is the influence of the former superstar and the best defender in the league. The so-called skinny camel is bigger than the horse.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Attack and defense efficiency + 26.9! Howard's two big data came first, and Davis also showdown James/476e140cd8c040d2b80e59f52c2d1383.jpg" alt="Attack and defense efficiency + 26.9! Howard&#39;s two big data came first, and Davis also showdown James"><br>According to the statistics of NBA official website, Howard’s direct bonus to the Lakers is not hidden data, but real data to reflect Howard’s influence. Although he is a substitute, but the performance has run over the starting McGrady. So far, when Howard is on the court, the Lakers’ attack efficiency (i.e. 100 round score) is 115.7 points, and defense efficiency (100 round score) is 90.4 points, ranking first in the league, with a net efficiency of 25.3 points.<br>And when Howard was not there, McGee picked up position five. The Lakers’ offense efficiency dropped to 97.3, defense efficiency to 98.9, and net efficiency to - 1.6.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Attack and defense efficiency + 26.9! Howard's two big data came first, and Davis also showdown James/21dc5de090124b59957b24e64da7ab69.jpg" alt="Attack and defense efficiency + 26.9! Howard&#39;s two big data came first, and Davis also showdown James"><br>That’s the difference between playing and playing. Howard can give the Lakers a + 26.9 attack and defense efficiency bonus. It’s a terrible number. Howard’s bonus on the Lakers’ bench is the first, even better than the starting line-up. What’s more surprising is that Howard’s physical condition is still recovering. He’s better than one game at a time. In the preseason, Howard’s bounce was a little bit worse and he didn’t move enough.<br>As the game progressed, Howard’s bounce began to recover and his movement became faster. Now he can not only top defense under the basket, but also prevent the small guard to complete the steal.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Attack and defense efficiency + 26.9! Howard's two big data came first, and Davis also showdown James/d578ba85d35a467483641191d2b3c7a0.jpg" alt="Attack and defense efficiency + 26.9! Howard&#39;s two big data came first, and Davis also showdown James"><br>So far this season, Howard has contributed 6.8 points and 8.2 rebounds per game, of which the shooting percentage is an astonishing 79.2%, the highest in the League at present. Howard’s integration also makes the atmosphere of the Lakers very wonderful. Today, Davis also talked about the current situation of the Lakers. Bushmei is very satisfied here. It seems that next year’s extension of the Lakers will not be a problem.<br>Davis played at will with the Lakers, and compared to the preseason and opening regular season openers. In the past five games, the brow has become more and more relaxed, and Howard and pop are back in their combination. They are like the combination of the Clippers’ Harrell and the rookie.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Attack and defense efficiency + 26.9! Howard's two big data came first, and Davis also showdown James/bda0357de1e844f697991b38213dedd8.jpg" alt="Attack and defense efficiency + 26.9! Howard&#39;s two big data came first, and Davis also showdown James"><br>When talking about his relationship with LeBron James, Davis also made public that he thought his relationship with James could not be called brother, but just like glue. Davis also said that James named their relationship “peanut butter banana sandwich.”<br>Davis said: “  I was traded by the pelicans this summer, and I didn’t spend much time training with LeBron. But I didn’t expect that we would be so tacit. We are like natural partners. LeBron once said to me, “we’re not peanut butter and jam sandwiches yet. We’re like peanut butter and banana sandwiches, but we can get better!”<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Attack and defense efficiency + 26.9! Howard's two big data came first, and Davis also showdown James/7d6b94de446c445a9befa9806ddc3226.jpg" alt="Attack and defense efficiency + 26.9! Howard&#39;s two big data came first, and Davis also showdown James"><br>Peanut butter banana sandwich  , it’s obvious that James still thinks that he and Davis haven’t cooperated to the same extent as he and Wade. Since both Wade and James have said that their relationship is like a peanut butter and jam sandwich, the next step for James and Davis is to turn the peanut butter and banana sandwich into a peanut butter and jam sandwich.</p>
