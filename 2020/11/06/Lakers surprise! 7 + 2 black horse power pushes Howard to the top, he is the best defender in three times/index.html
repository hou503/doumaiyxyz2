        <p>In a game that ended today, the Lakers won four straight games away, 119-110 to beat the lone Rangers. The Lakers’ record in the new season is obviously beyond the expectation of the fans. Especially after losing to Clippers in the first game, the Lakers fell into depression. A lot of fans also say that the Lakers need to break in, but in the next four games, they were blinded, and they greatly improved in both attack and defense. Howard’s protective frame, Davis’s offensive ability, James’s overall view.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Lakers surprise! 7 + 2 black horse power pushes Howard to the top, he is the best defender in three times/fbaeb94909244e9c818fabaa8bc07d6a.jpg" alt="Lakers surprise! 7 + 2 black horse power pushes Howard to the top, he is the best defender in three times"><br>And James has been improving in the last four games, and today he’s a big four. James is the first Lakers player to score at least 30 + 10 + 15 since 1990. At present, the Lakers have reached the top of the Western Conference. They are very balanced both in attack and defense. It’s also great to play hard, and there’s another surprise for the Lakers: balman bacaluso.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Lakers surprise! 7 + 2 black horse power pushes Howard to the top, he is the best defender in three times/76ecabc984ea426b893ed0b7e9e78514.jpg" alt="Lakers surprise! 7 + 2 black horse power pushes Howard to the top, he is the best defender in three times"><br>With more than 9 minutes left in the fourth quarter of today’s competition, Caruso entered the inner line. Facing the lone ranger’s inner line Kleiber, he completed a four seater barrier and showed his physical fitness. Many fans may not have a big impression of Caruso, and he has serious hair loss. This makes the fans always feel that he is not young and has a low sense of existence. In fact, Caruso was only 25 years old in 1994. In today’s game, Caruso played 15 minutes, 3 out of 5 got 7 points and 2 rebounds, although the data is not eye-catching, but Caruso is the Lakers’ real defensive first man, fiercer than Howard Davis.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Lakers surprise! 7 + 2 black horse power pushes Howard to the top, he is the best defender in three times/2c1519ae37f14f6182eb36cf1c7c1967.jpg" alt="Lakers surprise! 7 + 2 black horse power pushes Howard to the top, he is the best defender in three times"><br>In the latest defensive efficiency list, Caruso came in second, in fact, almost the same as the first. After all, Aton only played one game, and Caruso played four. Caruso’s current defensive efficiency is 79.4 points, while Coyote’s okoggi is 82.2. The 76ers’ emptybill is 85, while the Lakers’ Howard is 89.4.<br>The Lakers also have three people on the list, Davis + pop + Kuzma. Davis finished 36th with 94.4 defense efficiency. Pop came 28th on 92.8. Kuzma played a game today, ranking 29th with 92.9 defense efficiency.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Lakers surprise! 7 + 2 black horse power pushes Howard to the top, he is the best defender in three times/ba90f48e02844631ad62d7d0fbbe0ab8.jpg" alt="Lakers surprise! 7 + 2 black horse power pushes Howard to the top, he is the best defender in three times"><br>After the game LeBron James and Davis praised the performance of Caruso, including today’s dunk to show his physical fitness. In addition, there is the defense ability of Caruso. As coach Vogel said, people always underestimate Caruso and seldom know that he is a player with both attack and defence.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Lakers surprise! 7 + 2 black horse power pushes Howard to the top, he is the best defender in three times/5ba4bb85085a4a56a562ca04d4b52be3.jpg" alt="Lakers surprise! 7 + 2 black horse power pushes Howard to the top, he is the best defender in three times"><br>Davis said of Caruso: “today, Caruso came out and played in the right way, and he can make the right decision. Especially when he hit the basket tonight. He’s the kind of player who plays hard and knows how to play. We need players like him in our team!<br>Caruso is very calm on the court, he is a player who plays with his head completely. The so-called bald nature will become stronger. God deprived Caruso of his hair, but gave him a calm heart.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Lakers surprise! 7 + 2 black horse power pushes Howard to the top, he is the best defender in three times/f2fa6ec1f0c04280a55e114f9cb47857.jpg" alt="Lakers surprise! 7 + 2 black horse power pushes Howard to the top, he is the best defender in three times"><br>Often players like Caruso are stronger when the team is in adversity. No one could have guessed that Caruso would be second on the defensive efficiency list. Even Howard, the NBA’s three best defensive player, is just below Caruso.</p>
