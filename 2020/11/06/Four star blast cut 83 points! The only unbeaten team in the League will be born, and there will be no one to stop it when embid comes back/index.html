        <p>In a game that ended today, the 76 beat the Blazers 129-128 away. In this game, the great enbid did not play, 76 people still have four-star seat, hofford + Harris + Simmons + Richardson. Today, the ball is also really good-looking, in the core is not in the case of 76 people have been playing under pressure, once 21 points behind. But at the critical moment, the Blazers didn’t hold on to the victory. Kokmazi killed the Blazers in 0.4 seconds and 3 minutes. In the past, Roy and Lillard both performed the last-minute kill. This time, the pioneers experienced the bitter results of the past for the first time. It was so hard to be killed.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Four star blast cut 83 points! The only unbeaten team in the League will be born, and there will be no one to stop it when embid comes back/8cab39cd9afb42218b1e119752fb209d.jpg" alt="Four star blast cut 83 points! The only unbeaten team in the League will be born, and there will be no one to stop it when embid comes back"><br>From the start of the first quarter, the Blazers had the upper hand. They started 10-2. They were full of desire to attack and went with the wind and water. But Simmons is not to be outdone. In the absence of embid, he kept hitting the basket to score. Lillard also responded to Simmons in time at the end of the festival. The first quarter trailblazers led by 5 points, 32-27. In the second quarter, the attack of the pioneers did not decrease. Hood made a good jump shot. In the middle of hezonia, the pioneers made a wave of 6-0. The Blazers still led the 76ers by 11 points at 68-57 in the half.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Four star blast cut 83 points! The only unbeaten team in the League will be born, and there will be no one to stop it when embid comes back/4f22cf979e5945a294ba5a9703bde4c8.jpg" alt="Four star blast cut 83 points! The only unbeaten team in the League will be born, and there will be no one to stop it when embid comes back"><br>In the second half, under the leadership of Lillard, the trailblazers continued to spread the difference, once leading to 21 points. When 76 people were on the brink of extinction, they finally woke up like a dream. Harris has scored five points in a row, while Simmons and hofford are also firing. In the last minute, the 76ers got 6 points, and at the end of the three quarters, they were 10 points behind. Once again, the game was full of suspense.<br>At the end of the day, it was true that Horford started the mode of killing with a big shot. He hit two goals in the basket, and the 76ers were close to three points at one time. The Blazers began to worry, and Lillard came out in time. He hit three points first to stop bleeding, and then he joined hands with Bates morellion to score three points. Once again, the pioneers have the advantage, leading by 3 points!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Four star blast cut 83 points! The only unbeaten team in the League will be born, and there will be no one to stop it when embid comes back/517ad017a3bb4ab7a2f1fc6572993a67.jpg" alt="Four star blast cut 83 points! The only unbeaten team in the League will be born, and there will be no one to stop it when embid comes back"><br>The 76ers didn’t lose hope. At the last moment, Horford made a tough layup, and Simmons helped the 76ers to exceed one point in two free throws. And Lillard also showed his heart in life and death. In a round, Lillard scored a three-point shot for anfini. Leave 76 people 2.2 seconds. I didn’t expect that kirkmatz took the chance to kill in the last 0.4 seconds and 3 minutes.<br>In the whole game, 76 players and four stars played perfectly, scoring 83 points, Simmons 18 points, Horford 25 points, Richardson 17 points and Harris 23 points. In the absence of ebbed, the 76ers fought a tough battle. Lillard became a lone hero. He got 33 points and 9 out of 11-3 points and couldn’t get back to the sky.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Four star blast cut 83 points! The only unbeaten team in the League will be born, and there will be no one to stop it when embid comes back/828b948206b24ccba41ecbae7d099c6e.jpg" alt="Four star blast cut 83 points! The only unbeaten team in the League will be born, and there will be no one to stop it when embid comes back"><br>Last season, the 76ers lost to the Raptors, but they are the only team in the league that can fight against the Raptors in seven games. If it wasn’t for Leonard’s three points in the basket and the 76ers’ extra time, it’s hard to say who was the champion last season. For the 76ers were not afraid of the Bucks, and their five great deaths could be compared to the bucks. Even in terms of configuration, the 76ers are more fierce than the Raptors.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Four star blast cut 83 points! The only unbeaten team in the League will be born, and there will be no one to stop it when embid comes back/26240438d6f540c68a1d06e9c02fd62d.jpg" alt="Four star blast cut 83 points! The only unbeaten team in the League will be born, and there will be no one to stop it when embid comes back"><br>Although the 76ers lost Jimmy Butler this summer, Richardson also filled in Butler’s vacancy. Once the 76ers put out the five-star lineup of Simmons + enbid + Harris + Richardson + hofford, they are basically unstoppable. This year’s bucks don’t seem to have made much progress in shooting, while hofford, the 76ers, is a sharp weapon against alphanum.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Four star blast cut 83 points! The only unbeaten team in the League will be born, and there will be no one to stop it when embid comes back/e269541ad0e4459ea4137f06a24a684a.jpg" alt="Four star blast cut 83 points! The only unbeaten team in the League will be born, and there will be no one to stop it when embid comes back"><br>Once the 76ers five-star run in this season is complete, they can declare the end of the Eastern Conference. As Barkley said, the 76ers are the most promising team in the east to reach the finals. At present, the 76ers lead the league in five consecutive starts, and they are the only unbeaten team.</p>
