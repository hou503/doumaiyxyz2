        <p>In a regular season game that ended today, Minnesota beat the Wizards 131-109 away. The Timberwolves star Downes was banned from the game because he was punished by the League for his work with the great embid in the last game. But today the Timberwolves are not in trouble because of Downes’s absence. They have a strong team for the first time and are very calm. In particular, another champion Lang Wiggins woke up. In the absence of Downes, Wiggins really put the team on his shoulders. Maybe as Wiggins told the team boss this summer, he is not ready to keep fit, but to fulfill his talent.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/20+21+15! After Downes was banned, Wiggins became the boss/751eaa44e8714886b2d9ea7acef65a48.jpg" alt="20+21+15! After Downes was banned, Wiggins became the boss"><br>Today’s game really shows the attitude of Wiggins. From the first quarter on, Wiggins has been unstoppable. At the beginning of the game, he quickly entered the state. He grabbed both ends of the attack and defense. In the first nine minutes, Wiggins got 10 points, 2 rebounds, 4 assists and 1 block. It was Leonard. It also gave Minnesota an 8-point lead of 42-34 in the first quarter.<br>The second section of the forest wolf attack momentum is not reduced, rookie Calver up is the slam dunk hit, TIG and Geon also attack the Wizards basket scoring. The forest wolf made a wave of 14-4 attacks. Although the Wizards star bill even cut 4 points in response, but Wiggins also hit 3 points with color. The Timberwolves led by 14 points at half-time, 70-56.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/20+21+15! After Downes was banned, Wiggins became the boss/e8def8a67abf4258b8c386a95b7f975f.jpg" alt="20+21+15! After Downes was banned, Wiggins became the boss"><br>In the second half, the Timberwolves were still brave. They were crazy. Covington hit 2-3 points in a row. Okogi got a pass from Wiggins and beat the layup. Wiggins also interfered with the Wizards on the defensive side many times. In the third quarter, Timberwolves scored 106 points, only the Wizards got 72 points. The Timberwolves took the lead to 34 points and beat the game directly. At the end of the day, there was nothing to fight between the two sides. The Wizards surrendered early.<br>In terms of data, the Timberwolves: Tiger 15 points, 13 AIDS, Wiggins 21 points, 5 boards, 6 AIDS, coventon 20 points, 15 + 21 + 20. These three people have become the three giants of today’s Timberwolves, affecting the game at both ends of attack and defense.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/20+21+15! After Downes was banned, Wiggins became the boss/4119b2245c2a4624891679d11102fcd7.jpg" alt="20+21+15! After Downes was banned, Wiggins became the boss"><br>On the Wizards side, Bill scored 30 points, but made six mistakes, while little Thomas got 16 points and 7 helpers. It’s a good start for the Timberwolves because they’ve been so bad in the past few years and the whole team is desperate. As a result, Downes and Wiggins became cancer and soft egg.<br>Now that the two top scorers are awake, Downes has made an incredible performance this season. Wiggins also began to slowly cash in the talent, at least at the defensive end of Wiggins out of the attitude, and do not grab the ball right. When it’s time to attack, I’m not careless. It’s very clear to play.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/20+21+15! After Downes was banned, Wiggins became the boss/82ba0285aeea41338faa0e520452abe1.jpg" alt="20+21+15! After Downes was banned, Wiggins became the boss"><br>In the absence of Downes, the Timberwolves can still maintain this state. It can only be said that they have ushered in a transformation. Now Downes can be a comfortable spectator and it’s no problem to give the team to Wiggins. At least until your ban is lifted, the Timberwolves can still keep going. After Downes returns, the Timberwolves can continue to play a wave of climax.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/20+21+15! After Downes was banned, Wiggins became the boss/fd2a11b83d2a4e9296d49f85b5693ec1.jpg" alt="20+21+15! After Downes was banned, Wiggins became the boss"><br>The current lineup of the Timberwolves is not weak, TIG + Wiggins + Downes + Covington + Graham, in addition to Calvert on the bench. It’s time for the Timberwolves to play in the playoffs. Prove to Butler that without him, Wiggins and Downes can lead the team to the playoffs.</p>
