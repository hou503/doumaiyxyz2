        <p><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The pelican picked up a Durant! 174 points in 6 games, 170 million sprint after leaving the Lakers/c2602371b4f14398ae9370b45e77ae29.jpg" alt="The pelican picked up a Durant! 174 points in 6 games, 170 million sprint after leaving the Lakers"><br>In an NBA regular season game that ended on the morning of November 5, the Nets beat Pelican 135-125 at home, Ingram got 40 points and 5 rebounds and 5 assists in 37 minutes, continuing the hot state. Yingge, who was known as Durant’s successor at the beginning of the game, was short of the chance to prove himself in the Lakers. After arriving at Pelican, he picked up the team to move forward when Zion was injured. Last Pelican lost to thunder, Ingram was injured in the head and left the court. The examination results showed that there would be no concussion. Yingge, who continues to start today, started his duel with Owen.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The pelican picked up a Durant! 174 points in 6 games, 170 million sprint after leaving the Lakers/92343ae09b1d4f378402e174f3ab6baf.jpg" alt="The pelican picked up a Durant! 174 points in 6 games, 170 million sprint after leaving the Lakers"><br>In fact, Ingram was the top player in 2016. In the three years of playing for the Lakers, Ingram was far below the expectation of fans. In the thick brow trade, the Lakers didn’t want to send ZMA out of the library and put him in the trade. Previously, it was diagnosed that there was a deep vein thrombosis in the right shoulder. Originally, the pelican didn’t hold much hope for him, and didn’t renew his contract in advance before the start of the season, just The last year of Ingram’s contract, but Ingram in the first seven games but let everyone shine!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The pelican picked up a Durant! 174 points in 6 games, 170 million sprint after leaving the Lakers/4fa833cf8a1b4b8ab1ba5fc99970a521.jpg" alt="The pelican picked up a Durant! 174 points in 6 games, 170 million sprint after leaving the Lakers"><br>In the first game, Ingram easily got 22 points, 5 rebounds and 5 assists. In the third game, Ingram contributed 25 points, 8 rebounds and 3 assists. In the third game, Yingge sent 35 + 15 points, 27 + 10 points in the fourth game, 25 + 3 points in the fifth game. Yingge was injured and left in 13 minutes. In today’s game, he cut 40 + 5 + 5 points and 174 points in the sixth game, averaging 29 points, with a hit rate of 51.1%. Now, it’s true We can put Ingram in the position of Durant’s successor!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The pelican picked up a Durant! 174 points in 6 games, 170 million sprint after leaving the Lakers/1e6ec64251334dd5a3cbf6dca95891dd.jpg" alt="The pelican picked up a Durant! 174 points in 6 games, 170 million sprint after leaving the Lakers"><br>Today, we can see the significance of Yingge to pelicans from the first game with the nets. In the first quarter, Yingge scored 9 points in 4 of Yingge 4. When her teammates didn’t feel the same, Yingge resisted the heavy burden alone. In the third quarter, when the nets once pulled the difference to 20 points, Ingram stood up, three-point ball, jump shot, break through the emergency stop and hit the board. In the single quarter, Yingge scored 10 points and 3 assists. Pelican also played in the single quarter With a high score of 48 points, the nets, including Owen today, scored double for six people. Owen was in excellent condition, but still couldn’t defeat the pelican completely. Ingram played a crucial role.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The pelican picked up a Durant! 174 points in 6 games, 170 million sprint after leaving the Lakers/b20171b9213f4715b8bfc6f0c4d48972.jpg" alt="The pelican picked up a Durant! 174 points in 6 games, 170 million sprint after leaving the Lakers"><br>For the Lakers, they have given away the ball brother, Yingge and Hart, but they have got brother bushmei. At this stage, the Lakers won 5 consecutive victories and won the first place in the West. Their goal this season is to rush to the championship. At least at this stage, they will not regret it, because they need stars of this level.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The pelican picked up a Durant! 174 points in 6 games, 170 million sprint after leaving the Lakers/d17ebeb1d95a44d3abece7c1826416cc.jpg" alt="The pelican picked up a Durant! 174 points in 6 games, 170 million sprint after leaving the Lakers"><br>But for pelicans, it’s really a happy worry. In fact, they have the chance to reach an early renewal with Yingge before the start of the season. Although Simmons, sICAM, Murray and others have all got the top salary contract, if they negotiate with Yingge before the season, they really have the chance to complete the renewal in a non top salary way. But if Yingge continues to go crazy, it’s more than 20 points per game until Ming Dynasty In the summer of, the pelican offered another contract of about $100 million. Yingge would refuse. Would the pelican offer Yingge a contract of $170 million for five years?</p>
