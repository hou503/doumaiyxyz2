        <p>On November 8, a regular season NBA game ended at noon, the sun played against the heat at home. In fact, the sun had a chance to win the match at home. The heat’s Winslow, Haslem and Vites couldn’t play today, but they found that they couldn’t really play. The opposite batler is harder, and the opposite Dragic will cast three points than Rubio! 108-124, although the sun has lost three games this season, but this is the first time to be abused from head to tail!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/For the first time in the season! What the clippers, warriors and 76ers can't do, the heat did first/2eb04965c3884ab9ba9ad9da14807ded.jpg" alt="For the first time in the season! What the clippers, warriors and 76ers can&#39;t do, the heat did first"><br>Data, heat side, Butler 34 points 5 rebounds 4 assists, Adebayor about 15 points 10 rebounds 6 assists, Nan 11 points, Dragic 25 points 6 rebounds 4 assists, Hiro 15 points. Sun side, ubre 15 points, Baines 23 points 4 rebounds, Booker 22 points 5 assists, Rubio 11 points.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/For the first time in the season! What the clippers, warriors and 76ers can't do, the heat did first/7ce2a656d7cb47568818ee8b2b2db2da.jpg" alt="For the first time in the season! What the clippers, warriors and 76ers can&#39;t do, the heat did first"><br>From the first quarter on, Butler gave the sun a stick, breaking the board, three points on the outside line, emergency stop jump shot, nine points in a row, heat 18-6! The sun slowly regained his touch and returned a wave of 20-9 small climax, with the heat leading by 1 point in a single quarter. And Butler contributed 18 points in a single section! In the second quarter, the heat rely on Hiro and Dragic to take the initiative again with 10 points. The sun is slow and hot. They have to wait for bukeubre and others to come back to score, while Butler takes 7 points even at the end of the quarter. The heat leads 7 points in half time! Butler scored 30 points in the first half!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/For the first time in the season! What the clippers, warriors and 76ers can't do, the heat did first/91abd1f1de1d47fba078ecae02e4947d.jpg" alt="For the first time in the season! What the clippers, warriors and 76ers can&#39;t do, the heat did first"><br>The third quarter is almost the same. The heat is the climax of a wave of 13-7, led by Dragic. Then the sun finds his touch. The two sides slowly enter the tug of war. The heat is still 7 points ahead in the third quarter. The most critical fourth quarter, Dragic continues to feel hot, and is two three points, the sun this time can’t hold, Dragic and Orinoco in the middle of the straight five points to kill the game, the score was finally set at 102-124.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/For the first time in the season! What the clippers, warriors and 76ers can't do, the heat did first/32ca26fe72b74c2db3641579dde7bd5c.jpg" alt="For the first time in the season! What the clippers, warriors and 76ers can&#39;t do, the heat did first"><br>This is the first time the Suns have lost this season. They have no power to fight back. At present, the Suns are 5-3. In the first two games they lost, they lost 1 point extra time to nuggets, joaquich was trapped, Murray was entangled from head to tail by ubre, and finally they lost in extra time! Playing jazz, I lost only one point! In the game that Suns won, including the 29 point victory over kings, the home victory over clippers with small cards, and the half-time victory over flower warriors, the home victory over 76 people, including the victory over Grizzlies, the court was a tough battle. To be blunt, Suns would have won 7 consecutive games if they could seize the opportunity.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/For the first time in the season! What the clippers, warriors and 76ers can't do, the heat did first/79cd657648a042b18b2d6ce2bea757c4.jpg" alt="For the first time in the season! What the clippers, warriors and 76ers can&#39;t do, the heat did first"><br>But it’s just that we can’t beat the heat in this game! As Duan ran said, from all angles, it seems unreasonable. Only the heat can restrain the sun’s playing method. Butler and Adebayor’s forward combination limit the sun’s three-point goal today to only 11 out of 32. After the heat came on the bench, under the leadership of drajic and orinico, they also played triumphant songs all the way. Butler in the first half and Della in the second half Jiqi, let the sun have no chance to breathe!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/For the first time in the season! What the clippers, warriors and 76ers can't do, the heat did first/12efc0a0d1e64fb49a67c7f3029e097e.jpg" alt="For the first time in the season! What the clippers, warriors and 76ers can&#39;t do, the heat did first"><br>Of course, the sun’s future schedule is also very difficult, need to face the test of the nets, the Lakers, including the back-to-back Celtic king, to see if they can maintain the top four position in the West.</p>
