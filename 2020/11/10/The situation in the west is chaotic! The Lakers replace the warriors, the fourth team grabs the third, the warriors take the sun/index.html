        <p>On November 10, there are not many regular NBA games today, only five games, but the quality of the Games is very high. After five games, the situation in the West has become more and more chaotic. Compared with last season, the general direction has been determined. The Lakers have replaced the warriors and the Warriors have replaced the suns.<br>Talk about five games.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The situation in the west is chaotic! The Lakers replace the warriors, the fourth team grabs the third, the warriors take the sun/1605524ebe0849c9a3e166c8b9e60004.jpg" alt="The situation in the west is chaotic! The Lakers replace the warriors, the fourth team grabs the third, the warriors take the sun"><br>Celtic sweep the Spurs 135-115 away. In the game, another scene that people don’t want to see happened again. In the confrontation with Adelaide, Hayward broke his left hand, his arm was obviously stressed, and he put it on Adelaide’s right hand, which was just back to the peak, and the biggest setback in his life! Hope Hayward can recover soon! Of course, in today’s game, Celtic’s back court double shot performance was brilliant. Brown scored 30 points and 7 rebounds, and Walker also scored 26 points and 8 assists. After this game, Celtic ranked first in the East, 7-1 record!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The situation in the west is chaotic! The Lakers replace the warriors, the fourth team grabs the third, the warriors take the sun/6abd3756022c45aa8dd7487b27f8358b.jpg" alt="The situation in the west is chaotic! The Lakers replace the warriors, the fourth team grabs the third, the warriors take the sun"><br>The Hornets lost 110-115 at home to the pelican, Ingram scored 25 points, Redick scored 5-3 points and 20 points. With the victory of this game, the pelican officially got rid of the title of Western crane tail and kicked the warriors down.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The situation in the west is chaotic! The Lakers replace the warriors, the fourth team grabs the third, the warriors take the sun/4d958826bafd448ba814340ebfd2108f.jpg" alt="The situation in the west is chaotic! The Lakers replace the warriors, the fourth team grabs the third, the warriors take the sun"><br>The Bulls lost to mosaics 94-117 at home. In the first half, the bulls were only 1 point behind. As a result, the third quarter was spent directly. Mustache and youth scored 22 points in a single quarter. They beat the bulls in a wave. Mustache scored 42 points in this game, and the youth also scored 26 points. What’s interesting is that the garbage time of the game is so long. The yellow hair center has played for 42 minutes. Yes, no one is available on the bench.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The situation in the west is chaotic! The Lakers replace the warriors, the fourth team grabs the third, the warriors take the sun/a2e2093ad6c4489997b85f12e5efb87b.jpg" alt="The situation in the west is chaotic! The Lakers replace the warriors, the fourth team grabs the third, the warriors take the sun"><br>In the fourth quarter, the edge players of lone ranger got more chances to play. After this war, lone ranger won 6 and lost 3, tied for the third place in the West.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The situation in the west is chaotic! The Lakers replace the warriors, the fourth team grabs the third, the warriors take the sun/046e3e59c37945b896c4bcaca3d6bf74.jpg" alt="The situation in the west is chaotic! The Lakers replace the warriors, the fourth team grabs the third, the warriors take the sun"><br>Thunder beat warriors 114-108 at home. Warriors really did not put bad, Russell led the team in the third quarter to wipe out 17 points difference, the single quarter team got 41 points, the fourth quarter, said the collapse! Played until the end did not give up, but the difference is too big, lost! After this game, warriors are 2-8, with the west at the bottom. Remember the opponents warriors beat before: blazers, pelicans. In the next week, warriors will face jazz, Lakers and Celtic… Is this the bottom position in the west?<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The situation in the west is chaotic! The Lakers replace the warriors, the fourth team grabs the third, the warriors take the sun/6c163ddfb6284e53b887116b9ec54233.jpg" alt="The situation in the west is chaotic! The Lakers replace the warriors, the fourth team grabs the third, the warriors take the sun"><br>Take a look at the eastern rankings. After Celtic’s seven wins in a row, they are ranked first in the East. Raptors are also very strong, ranking second in the East. Behind them, heat, bucks and 76 are ranked 3-5. Knicks 2-7, better than warriors.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The situation in the west is chaotic! The Lakers replace the warriors, the fourth team grabs the third, the warriors take the sun/ee9c729588c742e9821013087fc51b99.jpg" alt="The situation in the west is chaotic! The Lakers replace the warriors, the fourth team grabs the third, the warriors take the sun"><br>Western rankings are much more complicated. The Lakers also won seven games in a row, ranking first in the West. Nuggets are still as close to the Lakers as they were to warriors last season. I’m afraid that the identity of the second millennium player will not change for a while. In the third place, the four teams are tied! Mosaic, clipper, jazz, lone ranger! It’s basically the return of the gods. The Suns behind can not be ignored, after all, their position is occupied by warriors, only showdown, can only sprint to the playoffs!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The situation in the west is chaotic! The Lakers replace the warriors, the fourth team grabs the third, the warriors take the sun/7bde28961a5c4417916d3e3e6e6efd49.jpg" alt="The situation in the west is chaotic! The Lakers replace the warriors, the fourth team grabs the third, the warriors take the sun"><br>Trailblazer 3 win 6 lose, and warriors form a pair of brothers and sisters, Lillard alone a little difficult. Pelican and grizzly bear will not say, the strength is like this, but warriors really did not put bad, every game players fighting spirit, attitude, hard work impeccable, today played to the last second did not give up, did not put bad, strength is so. Alas, the five-year system dominates the west, only one summer, and now it has become a stepping stone for other teams!</p>
