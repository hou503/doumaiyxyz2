        <p>On November 4, today’s NBA regular season is over. There are six games, except the first one between the Pacers and the bulls. Listen to me. First of all, we can be sure that with the deepening of the season, there may be a 12-to-8 situation in the West. The momentum of thunder and king is gradually picking up. Of course, the initiative is in their own hands, and it’s very easy to put it in bad condition. But there is only one team in the West that is currently the least competitive.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The west is in a mess! The Lakers keep the first, four teams in the same record, the warriors lose competitiveness at the bottom/8f24268bc26c4f658595e2257c3c24d1.jpg" alt="The west is in a mess! The Lakers keep the first, four teams in the same record, the warriors lose competitiveness at the bottom"><br>Let’s take a look at today’s competition. The Pacers beat the bulls 108-95 at home, winning three in a row after losing three in a row, and they are back in the top eight in the East. The match between King and Knicks is more exciting. Morris and Barrett are really fierce in Knicks, but Randall’s sense of existence is too low after losing the ball right. Frankly, he can’t do dirty work. Potis is even worse. He was pushed to No. 5 position to face berecha. In the third quarter, he hurt people maliciously. At last, King defeated Knicks 113-92 away from home. King won the second game of the season and successfully surpassed warriors. Nix, the last one in the East.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The west is in a mess! The Lakers keep the first, four teams in the same record, the warriors lose competitiveness at the bottom/520db34b93b14b0a8bdc5c38c1eb0491.jpg" alt="The west is in a mess! The Lakers keep the first, four teams in the same record, the warriors lose competitiveness at the bottom"><br>The heat beat a red team 129-100 at home. From the first quarter, the heat exploded. Leonard’s mid shot, Nathan’s and Butler’s three-point ball, Adebayor’s under basket hard play, the heat’s 46-14 score in a single quarter set three team history records, and the red team was also nailed to the stigma column in the first game. In the second quarter, the heat’s offensive momentum slowed down, but the red team also couldn’t score. They like to throw three points, but they just can’t make it. They simply break in Foul under the basket. And in the fourth quarter, the difference was pulled back to 40 points, which was terrible! Tell Paul I’m sorry. You’re the wrong one. Nobody can take them with you. By the way, the fat man should finish class quickly. Don’t lose face.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The west is in a mess! The Lakers keep the first, four teams in the same record, the warriors lose competitiveness at the bottom/4be100e62f034a32a173224132754146.jpg" alt="The west is in a mess! The Lakers keep the first, four teams in the same record, the warriors lose competitiveness at the bottom"><br>The Lakers beat the Spurs 103-96 on the road, which was also interesting. The Lakers once drew a 13 point gap. In the third quarter, the Spurs were wiped out successfully. In the fourth quarter, the Warcraft came out. The low post singles and violence filled the box. Popovich was so angry that he directly replaced bolt for introspection. In the last quarter of Warcraft, he scored 10 points, 6 rebounds and 2 blocks, dreaming back to the top! Although the old Zhan feel depressed, also has three pairs to enter the account, two consecutive three pairs, NBA history’s second oldest three pairs of players, Lakers five consecutive wins!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The west is in a mess! The Lakers keep the first, four teams in the same record, the warriors lose competitiveness at the bottom/e83a0ea771ed474da1b7636fb1c8ec22.jpg" alt="The west is in a mess! The Lakers keep the first, four teams in the same record, the warriors lose competitiveness at the bottom"><br>Solo Xiake field 131-111 sweep the Knights. In the first quarter, Lefu was able to fight with dongqiqi, but from the second quarter, the Cavaliers couldn’t hold up. Dongqiqi was placed in the position of small forward, like laozhan, who could control the rhythm, break through, pass, wave God in the Cavaliers’ inner line, all kinds of big hats, dongqiqi cut 29 + 15 + 14, dongqiqi beat laozhan across the air: you have two games and three pairs in a row, so can I! You look like 35 years old me, I look like 20 years old you<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The west is in a mess! The Lakers keep the first, four teams in the same record, the warriors lose competitiveness at the bottom/fff9eff0a35b41dc80f6c7a700393e1a.jpg" alt="The west is in a mess! The Lakers keep the first, four teams in the same record, the warriors lose competitiveness at the bottom"><br>Clippers beat jazz 105-94 at home. Jazz is the most aggrieved, leading 3 quarters, Mitchell broke out at the end of the 17 points alone, or lost! It was lost to Leonard, two records, three points and one back. All of a sudden, it raised the whole clipper’s morale. Then look at Harrell, the violence frame; look at Luwei, the unreasonable three points also came. The heart of killing and killing broke out in the fourth quarter. Mitchell cut 36 points in the air. It’s not like Leonard’s data. What happened in 4 of 15 in the first three quarters? The whole show can still get 30 points, superstar The ruling power of!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The west is in a mess! The Lakers keep the first, four teams in the same record, the warriors lose competitiveness at the bottom/de8d170d69044104b50837060c848f21.jpg" alt="The west is in a mess! The Lakers keep the first, four teams in the same record, the warriors lose competitiveness at the bottom"><br>In the Western Conference Ranking, the Lakers ranked first with 5-1 loss, losing 100 points per game, ranking second in the Western Conference and third in the league. The Timberwolves are close behind, the Clippers are third with 5-2, while the West has four teams with the same record: Lone Ranger, Nuggets, Suns and spurs. It’s too hard! At present, among the last few in the west, Pelican received good news today. Ingram is not in great trouble. He may play in the net next time. The king is far away. Only a grizzly bear is left with the warrior!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The west is in a mess! The Lakers keep the first, four teams in the same record, the warriors lose competitiveness at the bottom/79fa8f50b2c346d68f3ce83e3442c576.jpg" alt="The west is in a mess! The Lakers keep the first, four teams in the same record, the warriors lose competitiveness at the bottom"><br>Warriors today and harvest bad news, Russell may be due to ankle injury, continue to miss tomorrow’s home game against the Blazers! The warriors are likely to continue to put in that starting lineup of just seven million people: Stan, Robinson, Bowman, Jordan Poole, Pascal! Look at all sad ah! Against the old rivals, none of the big four can go up. The question is, can Lillard do it in the second quarter?</p>
