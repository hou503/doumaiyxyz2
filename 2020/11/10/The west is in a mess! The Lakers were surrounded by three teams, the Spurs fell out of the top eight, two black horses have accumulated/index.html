The Lakers were surrounded by three teams, the Spurs fell out of the top eight, two black horses have accumulated"><br>On November 6, there are 6 NBA regular season contests in total today, all of which are followed. It’s a bit messy, and the end time is too concentrated, which makes it hard for editors to write! After six games, the Lakers are at the top of the Western Conference with six wins in a row. Next, the schedule of the Lakers is relatively easy. Now let’s see who can pull the Lakers down.<br>Let’s talk about today’s game!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The west is in a mess! The Lakers were surrounded by three teams, the Spurs fell out of the top eight, two black horses have accumulated/fc757bc2cf4f4a50aab0bb4f01095d77.jpg" alt="The west is in a mess! The Lakers were surrounded by three teams, the Spurs fell out of the top eight, two black horses have accumulated"><br>Hornets beat Pacers 122-120 at home. The two winning teams are in good condition. The walkers once led the opponents by 19 points, but they were even in the regular period. Thank the referee! In overtime, the Hornets are relying on free throws to win the opponent! The comparison of free throws in the whole game, Hornets 42 times, walkers 7 times. The disparity is too great! After this battle, the hornet with a wave of three consecutive wins, into the eastern top eight!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The west is in a mess! The Lakers were surrounded by three teams, the Spurs fell out of the top eight, two black horses have accumulated/63db185db77841158485166023d7ba6a.jpg" alt="The west is in a mess! The Lakers were surrounded by three teams, the Spurs fell out of the top eight, two black horses have accumulated"><br>Celtic 119-113 defeat knight. Hayward burst out, scoring 39 points, 7 rebounds and 8 assists, 16 of 16 two-point shots, playing in the third quarter, unbelieving evil, three-point shots have to be cast several times, three iron, or two points better! The Cavaliers didn’t give up the game, the fourth quarter also played a wave of 13-2 climax, but Hayward’s last-minute make-up shot completely killed the suspense of the game, Hayward set a new scoring record in Boston. Celtic are currently 5-1, second in the East!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The west is in a mess! The Lakers were surrounded by three teams, the Spurs fell out of the top eight, two black horses have accumulated/d548561a17854c97933c57ee180fbd5e.jpg" alt="The west is in a mess! The Lakers were surrounded by three teams, the Spurs fell out of the top eight, two black horses have accumulated"><br>The Hawks beat the Spurs 108-100 at home. As a Spurs fan, it may be very desperate, if there are any Spurs fans. In the first half, Trey young scored 0 in 8, and got 1 point by free throw. In the second half, Trey young combined with Xu Erte to bomb the Spurs from all angles and three-dimensional, all kinds of three-point goals! In the fourth quarter, the Hawks scored 38 points. The Spurs couldn’t get any points. They were desperate! In the second half, Trey young scored 28 points, 13 assists and 2 steals. Who can control him?<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The west is in a mess! The Lakers were surrounded by three teams, the Spurs fell out of the top eight, two black horses have accumulated/26cc2f5aba374ab78b99fb0cf9a1a1bc.jpg" alt="The west is in a mess! The Lakers were surrounded by three teams, the Spurs fell out of the top eight, two black horses have accumulated"><br>The Lakers beat the bulls 118-112, fell 19 points at one time. The trip home of bushmei was so depressed that they all shook their heads. Howard only got three fouls in the first nine minutes. He didn’t finish the first half. The Lakers made 11 mistakes! Can we win? Cook’s three points, Howard’s slam dunk, Kuzma’s consecutive layup, the Bulls players were confused: our coach only taught us how to defend old Zhan and bushmei, but not how to play the Lakers’ backup! In fact, the Lakers need more people to come forward and share the pressure of Jamie. It’s impossible that they are always accurate and in good condition! And this wave of six consecutive victories, including green, Howard, cook and Kuzma, all contribute their strength to both ends of the attack and defense, which is enough!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The west is in a mess! The Lakers were surrounded by three teams, the Spurs fell out of the top eight, two black horses have accumulated/490f8fc931df490ca7b21489363537ab.jpg" alt="The west is in a mess! The Lakers were surrounded by three teams, the Spurs fell out of the top eight, two black horses have accumulated"><br>In the other two games, thunder defeated magic 102-94 at home, Paul sent 20 + 6 data, Nuggets 109-89 swept the first heat in the East, spending three quarters.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The west is in a mess!

The Lakers were surrounded by three teams, the Spurs fell out of the top eight, two black horses have accumulated"><br>In terms of ranking, at present, the number one player in the East is 76, Celtic are tied, both 5-1, the heat momentum is good, but today’s game is really not suitable for Denver’s Highland home court. The Bucks followed, with raptors, wasps, eagles and walkers in the top eight. Nix is free and easy.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The west is in a mess! The Lakers were surrounded by three teams, the Spurs fell out of the top eight, two black horses have accumulated/d76faf4129ff48f197dd59802c1aeaa5.jpg" alt="The west is in a mess! The Lakers were surrounded by three teams, the Spurs fell out of the top eight, two black horses have accumulated"><br>On the western side, the Lakers have a strong position of No. 1 in the West with a six game winning streak. But behind the Lakers, Nuggets, Suns and Clippers are all 5-2, holding a tight position against the Lakers. Suns are the most amazing. They beat kings, nuggets and jazz with one point. They beat clippers and warriors in a row. It’s not polite to say that this team full of abandoned players in the league is now reborn. Baines can cast three points and open space. Rubio organizes. Booke scores with all his strength. Ubere kills on the flank. Although it’s not the top in the west, it’s not the best team in the world It’s tough!<br>The Spurs have lost 1-3 in the last four games, losing to the clippers and the Lakers, and to the eagles, and have fallen out of the top eight.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The west is in a mess! The Lakers were surrounded by three teams, the Spurs fell out of the top eight, two black horses have accumulated/b8f8f92ac6674eb3bdf30cd8533d8c09.jpg" alt="The west is in a mess! The Lakers were surrounded by three teams, the Spurs fell out of the top eight, two black horses have accumulated"><br>The other black horse in the West belongs to the lone ranger, or the lone ranger has the strength to attack the top six or even the top four in the West. Their schedule has been the most difficult since the start of the lone ranger game, including a series of games against the Blazers, Nuggets, Lakers, etc., but they are very stable, and they can win the ball and never lose. Dongqiqi has two consecutive matches and three doubles, with 15 assists in a row. After Kyd, the first solo player, Posen has gradually adapted to the system of solo player. He and Powell partner complement each other in the inner line. The best embodiment of the game is to beat nuggets. When dongqiqi is in a downturn, more people stand out in the ball team, but when dongqiqi breaks out, it is almost unstoppable. Unless it’s the Lakers, go for each other!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The west is in a mess! The Lakers were surrounded by three teams, the Spurs fell out of the top eight, two black horses have accumulated/c86cd911d4ea4732848ead42ea6a271a.jpg" alt="The west is in a mess! The Lakers were surrounded by three teams, the Spurs fell out of the top eight, two black horses have accumulated"><br>At present, in the west, Grizzlies and pelicans are in a worrying state. Grizzlies are rebuilding. Pelicans are injured by Zion. Although Yingge can score 29 points per game, pelicans are still hard to compete. Wait for Zion to return and see if the top talent can be realized. In just half a year, I have experienced two injuries!</p>
